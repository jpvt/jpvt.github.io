## Me

Hey, I'm João Pedro. (Since it's a complicated name to pronounce in english, you can call me JP)

I'm from São Paulo, Brazil. Though, I have spent most of my life where I currently live João Pessoa, Brazil.

I'm a Computer Engineering Undergrad student at the [Federal University of Paraíba](https://www.ufpb.br), and a Machine Learning Researcher at [ArIA - Artificial Intelligence Applications Laboratory](https://aria.ci.ufpb.br), where I've been studying Artificial Intelligence for the past months.

Outside of computer science, I enjoy learning random stuff, traveling, playing Dungeons&Dragons, and caffeine :)

## What I know

As a result of my curiosity, I have practical experience with a few technologies including :

Python  • PostgreSQL • Scikit-Learn • NLTK • Pandas • Numpy • C/C++ • Modern OpenGL • OpenCV • Linux • Apache Kafka • Docker

for use with concepts such as:

Machine Learning Algorithms • Data Analysis • Natural Language Processing • Database Systems • Microsservices • Computer Vision • Containers • Computer Graphics • Data Visualization

## Certificates I've completed:

From time to time I take online courses for different Data Science Topics and work independently on projects in my free time. Some of them:

* Machine Learning A-Z™: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science - Udemy

* Deep Learning A-Z™: Hands-On Artificial Neural Networks - Udemy

* Deep Learning and Computer Vision A-Z™: OpenCV, SSD & GANs - Udemy

* Intro to Statistics - Udacity

* Data Structures & Algorithms in Python - Udacity

Check out my [portfolio](https://jpvt.github.io/projects/) to see iPython notebooks and Github repos for some of the projects I've worked on.

And that's it ! Feel free to connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jpvt) or get in touch. I'm always happy yo help !
